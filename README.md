# Product recommendation engine

This repository contains 2 folders namely - Deployment and Modeling.

The modeling folder constitutes 2 .ipynb files one each for Retail, Brand and product category offers. It also briefly explains the logic behind in getting offers and recommending the
same to users. We leveraged NLP tools and technologies for this use cases, that is BERT for text embeddings, similarity metrics like cosine and jaccard similarity et al. 

We also created a webapp leveraging Flask api, HTML/CSS/Javascript as development technologies and hosted the website on Ngrok which can be accessed using the link - https://50b3-24-0-145-36.ngrok-free.app/
